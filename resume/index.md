Welcome, it's an honor for me that you've reached here! I'm Pavly Gerges, aka. pavl_g, a common nickname used for API authorships and Open-Source Licenses for my projects, and the projects that I've contributed to. I'm essentially a self-taught OSS Engineer from the medical profession totally filled with the passion towards open-science and open-source Hardware/Software Engineering. I graduated from the faculty of Medicine and Surgery, October 6 University in 2023. Though I'm a medical candidate, I've got enough wisdom over these years to find the common scientific bases among Software Engineering and Medicine, which are very huge to list them here in this section. Comprehensively, through this genuine way, I've been able to focus on and study both fields. Regarding computer engineering, I'm currently studying Embedded Systems, and Game Engines Development among other pure sciences including, but not limited to, Calculus, Linear Algebra and Discrete Mathematics. As regard to medicine, I'm currently putting my focus on Critical Care, particularly the Neuro- and Cardio-pulmonary Critical Care, and I could tell you, that the ideas captured from studying the common scientific bases have tremendously helped me over this time. All my studies in both fields run from books, documentation manuals, technical reports, and journals, and rarely workshop webinar tutorials. I'll leave you with my compliments; that is "If you want to build something new, something ingenious, you have to have a structured way to conclude your approach and design your solution. No proceedings can be made without this point in-mind". To not make this section longer, you can read [my detailed journey to the tech industry here on this archived version](https://github.com/pavly-gerges/pavly-gerges/blob/main/resume/archived.md#my-journey-to-the-tech-industry).

## Experience:
**jMonkeyEngine Contributions:** I've been working for jMonkeyEngine, an open-source code-first approach game engine suite written primarily in Java with GLSL Java bindings and modular API design, **for about 4 years**, and still there. During my first year, I proposed and introduced [JmeSurfaceView](https://github.com/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/tree/master/jme3-android/src/main/java/com/jme3/view/surfaceview), a GL Surface View handler component for embedding jMonkeyEngine Game Contexts into Android Layout Designs, and it's proven comptency over time in this pilot project [Game-HCI](https://github.com/Electrostat-Lab/Game-HCI), which houses reusable I/O Game GUI components together with lifecycle linkage through command-state and strategy patterns. I worked on another shiny feature, a [ContrastAdjustmentFilter](https://github.com/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/pull/1665); that is essentially a postprocessor filter GLSL API that controls the 3D-color-gamut contrast using a power law, and was introduced in [jMonkeyEngine v3.5.0-beta4](https://github.com/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/releases/tag/v3.5.0-beta4). In addition to these features, I've taken the initiative in writing JavaDocs for a 7-year-old undocumented and vague animation system (MonkeyAnim), and succeeded with the team guidance to [deliver some of it](https://github.com/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/pulls?q=is%3Apr+com.jme3.anim+is%3Aclosed+author%3Apavly-gerges) on the currently working release [jMonkeyEngine v3.7.0](https://github.com/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/releases/tag/v3.7.0-alpha1). Other things that I had worked on in jMonkeyEngine are issues related to the Android [jme3-android](https://github.com/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/commits/master/jme3-android?author=pavly-gerges) and the core modules [jme3-core](https://github.com/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/commits/master/jme3-core?author=pavly-gerges). Have fun glancing over the PRs that I have initiated [here](https://github.com/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/commits?author=pavly-gerges), and the [issues](https://github.com/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/issues?q=is%3Aissue+Scrappers+is%3Aopen) that I've participated into. I am currently fluctuating in ranking between #27-#30 out of a 100 contributor, though it's silly to do comparisons this way, I am proud of this progress so far. The journey with jMonkeyEngine has come to no end yet; I designed [Serial4j](https://github.com/Electrostat-Lab/Serial4j) back in 2021, a Java Terminal I/O framework for serial interfaces (e.g., Serial USB and RS232) based on the Data-Flow and the Data-centered architectural designs, in which I've blended a lot of my skills, including but not limited to, developing APIs using C/C++, building dynamic native libraries, using Gradle and CMake to build JNI applications, testing memory leaks, designing and implementing modal logic algorithms and byte-flow patterns, hardware/software co-design, plus introducing [a vision for distributed simulation systems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GFGsH4eyJs&t=235s). This project particularly was an initiative for others such as: [jSnapLoader](https://github.com/Electrostat-Lab/jSnapLoader/), a high-performance platform-independent native dynamic library extractor and loader API exposing the direct use of the data-flow patterns and strong abstractions for Jar-Assets manipulations, and [ShiftAvr](https://github.com/Electrostat-Lab/ShiftAvr/), an arduino-alternative IO library for AVR MCUs written purely in C, in which I've leveraged my C programming skills, embedded design, and CMake and Bash scripting. During this period, I also have built a couple of community projects including the [Crossplatform-template](https://github.com/Electrostat-Lab/Cross-platform-template), [jme-alloc](https://github.com/Electrostat-Lab/jme-alloc), [DB-Training](https://github.com/Electrostat-Lab/DBTraining), and [jme3-simple-examples](https://github.com/Electrostat-Lab/jme3-Simple-Examples). Other contributions to the jMonkeyEngine community are entailed to the jMonkeyEngine [forums Q&A](https://hub.jmonkeyengine.org/u/pavl_g/activity) and helping people in troubleshooting and finding solutions.
